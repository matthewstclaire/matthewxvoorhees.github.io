I had spent years in recruiting using various types of technology. After a few years I ended up at tech company who was using their app to not only promote more effective work, but also make a positive impact on the world. Throughout my time with this company I frequently partnered with developers on my ideas to improve the app for anyone using it. What was crazy about this is they often listened to me!

I went from finding people in phone books to attracting hundreds of candidates through an app. On top of the success I was seeing I was also feeling like a real contributor to something important. After some time talking with developers looking to solve bugs, or make improvements, my excitement soon turned to envy. I was so jealous that Iâ€™d never be able to solve the problems that were coming up. After speaking with them and researching what software development entailed, I knew that I had to do my best to learn as much as possible. 

Following a similar path to most people I was pointed in the direction of HTML and CSS. I made countless websites trying to understand what these languages were. The sites often looked like MySpace profiles dedicated to my favorite movie characters. The Jason Voorhees and Leatherface sites turned out to be some of my most advanced. Once I had seen some success with these languages I craved more. Once again hours of researching what to learn I landed on the idea of bootcamps. What could I accomplish if I spent half a year solely learning how to program? I built my savings until it was time to make a move. A daring plunge into an entirely new career after already having establishment as a recruiter. 

I always remind myself that I want to be the person who creates the tools that are handed down. I want to be the person who solves the problem when the tools break. I want to build meaningful technology that will help people. These ideas drive me to trust in my leap of faith. I am excited to document this journey as I progress. Thank you!
